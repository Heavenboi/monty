## Hey there, we're Tafadzwa and Nigel!

Welcome to our Monty project! 🚀 Prepare to embark on an epic coding journey as we explore the captivating world of C programming, stacks, and queues. Get ready to dive into the fascinating realms of LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) data structures, and join us as we conquer thrilling challenges!

## 🎮 Our Project Adventure

We're not just writing code; we're crafting an adventure! Through this project, we'll be delving into the heart of data management. From pushing elements to popping, swapping, and adding, we'll be mastering the intricacies of stacks and queues one step at a time. Get ready to witness our coding skills in action!

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Our mission is to level up our coding prowess by accomplishing the following:
- Unleash the magic of LIFO and FIFO for efficient data manipulation.
- Roll up our sleeves and dive into real-world coding with stack and queue operations in C.
- Conquer the realm of data structures and algorithms, building a rock-solid foundation.
- Uncover the diverse and practical applications of stacks and queues.
- Harness the power of global variables to take our code to the next level.

## 👥 Team Collaboration

Meet the dynamic duo behind this coding extravaganza:
- **Tafadzwa Aaliaya Ndoro**
- **Nigel Zenda**

With our combined skills, creativity, and determination, we're here to code, conquer, and leave our mark on this project!

## ⏳ Project Timeline

Our adventure begins on:
- **Start Date:** August 22, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** August 25, 2023, 6:00 AM

## 🚀 Let's Dive In

Get ready to immerse yourself in an array of exciting tasks where we'll breathe life into stack and queue operations. From pushing to swapping and beyond, every task is a puzzle waiting to be solved!

## 🔥 Our Approach

Guided by our passion and guided by best practices, we're embarking on this adventure with a solid approach:
- Our favorite editors – vi, vim, or emacs – are our trusted companions.
- Code clarity reigns supreme as we adhere to the stylish Betty style.
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and gcc are our partners-in-code for seamless compilation.
- Comprehensive documentation makes our code accessible to all curious minds.
- With malloc and free, we're managing memory like coding ninjas.
- We're embracing the elegance of a single global variable.
- Our code is a masterpiece of modularity with no more than 5 functions per file.
- "monty.h" proudly houses our function prototypes.

## 🌟 Ready for Liftoff?

We're armed with enthusiasm and powered by coffee as we take on this exhilarating Monty project. Let's turn lines of code into magic and code challenges into triumphs. Join us in this coding odyssey – it's going to be legendary!
